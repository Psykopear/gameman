# gameman (Work in progress)

gameman is a game boy emulator written in rust in my free time as a hobby project.
I'm doing it mostly for learning rust and emulation in general.

# Roms

The roms should be placed in a directory called roms at the root of project
The boot rom should be named DMG_ROM.bin
