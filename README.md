# gameman (Work in progress)
gameman is a game boy emulator written in rust in my free time as a hobby project.
I'm doing it mostly for learning both rust and emulation.

# Roms

The roms should be placed in a directory called roms at the root of project.
The boot rom should be named DMG_ROM.bin

# Progress so far

Nintendo logo falls down and Tetris main screen is shown
